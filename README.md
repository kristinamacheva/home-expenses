# Home Expenses

## Overview
"Home Expenses" is a web application designed to optimize the calculation and distribution of financial responsibilities among household members. The main problem it addresses is how to manage and allocate household expenses more efficiently, avoiding the need for separate payments for each expense. By calculating each member's share of the expenses and adding the final amount to the household's total balance, the application allows for better organization and control of finances while reducing the risk of missed or duplicate payments.

Benefits of using the app include saving time, avoiding conflicts over upcoming and paid expenses, and improving budget planning. The app offers three different roles: household admin, regular user, and child. The Admin has full control over the household, including the management of households, household members, and expenses. The Regular User can add, edit, and delete the expenses they create. The Child role has limited rights, allowing parents to involve younger household members in managing finances without giving them full access.
